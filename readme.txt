# Driver Drowsiness Introduction 

This project is an introductory website for an Exclusive, EEG based Driver Drowsiness Detection system submitted as a Final Year Project to Bahria University.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

1. Clone the application:
`$ git clone https://github.com/yahyawasim97/dddintroduction`

2. Start the application:
`open index.html`

## Functionality

This project is used to detect driver drowsiness by analyzing EEG(electroencephalogram) signals of the driver. It is based on MERN stack and uses the principals of Artificial Intelligence to produce more accurate results. The quality of this system is that is not affected by Environmental Factors


## Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to provide some contribution in Brain Computing.
